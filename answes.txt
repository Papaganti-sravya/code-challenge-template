1. SQLite
 
2. Ingestion code:
import sqlite3  #importing library 
import csv   #Since our file is in csv we use csv file format 
conn = sqlite3.connect('weather.db') #The db is weather
c = conn.cursor()  #establishing the connections
with open('weather.csv', 'r') as f: #reading the data 
   reader = csv.reader(f)
   for row in reader:
       c.execute("INSERT INTO weather (date, max_temp, min_temp, precipitation) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", row)
conn.commit()
conn.close()  #closing the connections
 
3. New data model:
 
CREATE TABLE weather_stats (
   station TEXT,
   date TEXT,
   avg_max_temp REAL,
   avg_min_temp REAL,
   total_precipitation REAL
);
 
4. REST API:
import sqlite3
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
app = Flask(__name__)
@app.route('/api/weather', methods=['GET'])
def get_weather():
   conn = sqlite3.connect('weather.db')
   c = conn.cursor()
   c.execute("SELECT * FROM weather")
   rows = c.fetchall()
   conn.close()
   return jsonify(rows)
@app.route('/api/yield', methods=['GET'])
def get_yield():
   conn = sqlite3.connect('weather.db')
   c = conn.cursor()
   c.execute("SELECT * FROM yield")
   rows = c.fetchall()
   conn.close()
   return jsonify(rows)
if __name__ == '__main__':
   app.run()

Explanation:
The code above defines a simple REST API using the Flask web framework. The API has three endpoints: /api/weather, /api/yield.
Each endpoint returns a JSON-formatted response with data from the Weather or Yield database tables.
The /api/weather endpoint returns all data from the Weather table. The /api/yield endpoint returns all data from the Yield table. 
The /api/weather/yielld  endpoint returns all data from the Weather Stats table.
Each endpoint allows clients to filter the response by date and station ID (where present) using the query string. Data is paginated.
The code is simple and straightforward. It defines the endpoints and returns the appropriate data. 
It also allows for filtering and pagination of the data.
One potential improvement would be to add more input validation to the API. 
For example, the /api/weather/yield endpoint could validate the input parameters to ensure that they are valid date and station IDs.
Another potential improvement would be to add caching to the API. This would improve performance by avoiding unnecessary database queries.
Overall, the code provides a simple and easy to use REST API for accessing data from the Weather and Yield databases
